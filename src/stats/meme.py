    Smoothing is needed to handle the cases when users have very diverse like rates

    Step 1. Change target to the symmetrical form:

        like_symmetrical: (0, 1) -> (-1, 1)

    Step 2. Calculate symmetrical like rate for each user

        user_like_rate = avg(like_symmetrical)

    Step 3. Calculate smoothed likes
